# Power-BI-call-center-analysis
This project forms a crucial component of my virtual job experience program with PwC Switzerland, where I undertook the responsibility of developing a strategic dashboard for a telecom client grappling with customer retention challenges. Tasked by the Senior Manager of the call center, our objective was to leverage data analysis to unearth actionable insights that would bolster customer retention efforts.
I developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to visualize relevant KPIs and metrics from the provided dataset. The dashboard included real-time data on overall customer satisfaction, calls answered versus abandoned, call distribution by time, average speed of answer, and an agent performance quadrant comparing average handle time (talk duration) to calls answered.

## Key Insights:

- **Customer Satisfaction:** Visualizing overall customer satisfaction enabled the client to monitor service quality and identify areas needing improvement.
- **Call Handling Metrics:** The dashboard provided clear insights into the number of calls answered versus abandoned, helping the client understand call center efficiency and customer experience.
- **Temporal Analysis:** By analyzing calls by time, the client could identify peak call times and optimize staffing to reduce wait times and improve service levels.
- **Operational Efficiency:** The average speed of answer metric highlighted areas for reducing customer wait times and improving overall responsiveness.
- **Agent Performance:** The agent performance quadrant offered a detailed view of individual performance, balancing average handle time against calls answered to identify top performers and areas for training.
